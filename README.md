🔥 Drift Run: Roguelike Racing Chaos 🚗💀
There is no finish line—only survival. You are the destroyer of roads, drifting through a collapsing world where every move seals your fate. The track shifts unpredictably, the abyss follows close behind, and one wrong turn means the end.

💀 Pure Roguelike Experience: No second chances—every run is a fresh test of skill.
🏁 Randomly Generated Tracks: Adapt to the ever-changing road or fall into oblivion.
⚡ Fast-Paced Drift Mechanics: Precision is key—drift too slow, and you won’t make it.
🚗 Unlockable Vehicles: Survive longer, prove your worth, and access new rides (only for that run).
🎵 Intense Soundtrack: Feel the rush as you carve your path through destruction.

You are not just racing—you are outrunning the end of the world.
